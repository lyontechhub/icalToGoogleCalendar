iCal to Google Calendar
=======================

This simple app aims to synchronize events from iCal (from Meetup typically) to a Google Calendar (LyonTechHub one in this case).

It pulls CSV file from URLs (hard coded for now -> to be done: read JSON files from [LyonTechHub web site](https://github.com/lyontechhub/lyontechhub.github.io/data)), and then connect to Google to synchronize events. It synchronizes only next 2500 events (limit of Google API for one query, else we need to recurse...not done for now)

Development
-----------

It is written in F#. Just install it and you can for example use VSCode + Ionide plugins to edit.

To create events on Google Calendar, we need to authenticate on Google API. It uses [Service Account](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/dotnet/guide/aaa_oauth#service-account), i.e. a certificate (P12 file) generated by Google (in Google Console) to allow write access to the calendar (read is public). Note that when you generate the certificate, you have a "mail" address (Service Account ID) you must give read/write access to the calendar.

The certificate used in production must be kept secret.
